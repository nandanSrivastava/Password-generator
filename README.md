**Password Generator**

This project is a simple and secure password generator web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to generate strong, random passwords that meet their desired length and character complexity.

**Features:**

- Generates random passwords of user-specified length (e.g., 8, 12, 16 characters)
- Offers options to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- Displays the generated password in a user-friendly format
- Provides a button to copy the password to the clipboard for easy pasting

**Project Setup:**

1. **Create a project directory:** Make a new folder for your project files.
2. **Create essential files:** Inside the directory, create three files:
   - `index.html`: This will be the main HTML document for your web page.
   - `style.css`: This file will house the CSS styles for your password generator's layout and appearance.
   - `script.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript code that generates passwords and handles user interactions.

**Project Structure:**

```
password-generator/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

**Running the Project:**

1. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:** Open `index.html` directly in your browser to run the password generator application.

**Further Development:**

- Implement password strength meter to provide visual feedback on the generated password's security.
- Allow users to exclude specific characters (e.g., ambiguous characters like "1" and "l") for enhanced security.
- Integrate password manager features for saving generated passwords securely.

**Security Considerations:**

- **Do not store passwords:** This web application does not store generated passwords on the user's device or any server. Passwords are created and displayed in the browser for immediate use.
- **Avoid insecure practices:** Never prompt users to enter existing passwords or store them in plain text.
- **HTTPS recommendation:** Consider using HTTPS if deploying this application online to encrypt communication and enhance security.
